A Pokedex of the first generation of Pokemon taken from [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co), displays two screens. The first is the list of each of the Pokemon. When any Pokemon are clicked, navigates to screen for specific Pokemon, listing abilities and moves in addition to the image, name and type.
